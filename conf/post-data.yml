    title:     Basics of ArrayLists
    content:   "<p>
                    <strong>ArrayList Quick Guide</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    General:
                    <br>
                    An ArrayList is one of the most popular data structures within java for simple Object storage. An ArrayList offers quite a bit more functionality compared to a regular Array.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Pros:
                    <br>
                    - Dynamic size
                    <br>
                    - Works with Generics
                    <br>
                    - Iterable
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Declaration:
                    <br>
                    ArrayList<String> myArrList = new ArrayList<String>();
                    <br>
                    *You can replace 'String' with any Object Type
                    <br>
                    ** 'myArrList' is the variable name, you can name your ArrayList however you want
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Commonly Used Methods:
                    <br>
                    add( Object o ) - puts reference to object into ArrayList
                    <br>
                    get( int index ) - retrieves object reference from ArrayList index position
                    <br>
                    size() - returns ArrayList size
                    <br>
                    remove( int index ) - removes the element at the specified position in this list. Shifts any subsequent elements to the left and returns the element that was removed from the list.
                    <br>
                    indexOf( Object o) - finds the index in this list of the first occurrence of the specified element
                    <br>
                    clear() - removes all of the elements
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Example Code:
                    <br>
                    import java.util.ArrayList;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    public class Ex01 {
                    <br>
                       public static void main(String[] args) {
                    <br>
                         &emsp;ArrayList<String> myArrList = new ArrayList<String>();
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Bob\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Joseph\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Alan\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Erika\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Tyler\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Jenn\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Eric\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Llama\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Foo\");
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.add(\"Bar\");
                    <br>
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.remove(0);
                    <br>
                           &emsp;&emsp;myArr.remove(5);
                    <br>
                           &emsp;}
                    <br>
                    }
